Build: LucidBot 3.3

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
There are some database related upgrade issues. If you're updating from a build prior to b44, don't go straight to the 3.3 release. Rather update to 3.0 RC1 first, and then to FINAL afterwards.

What's new:
* Updated libraries
* Fixed an army parsing bug

How to update:
1. Replace LucidBot.jar
2. Replace the plugin folder
3. Replace the lib folder
