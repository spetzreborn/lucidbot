Build: LucidBot 3.0 RC2

What's new:
* /spells_ops for posting spells and ops from ingame to the bot via the web service
* Fix to logging - logging for channels was case sensitive
* Bug fixes for the API, removing some null pointer exceptions that would result in BAD REQUEST errors
* /intel can now take raw intel of any sort, so you don't have to post single sots and soms and such to /intel/sots etc.
* Fixed a bug where the bot would try to reconnect when you called !quit, before it finally shut down
