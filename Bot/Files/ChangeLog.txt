Build: LucidBot 3.2

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
There are some database related upgrade issues. If you're updating from a build prior to b44, don't go straight to the 3.1 release. Rather update to 3.0 RC1 first, and then to FINAL afterwards.

What's new:
* Scripting fixes and more elaborate examples (for python)

How to update:
1. Replace LucidBot.jar
2. Replace utopia-api.jar in the plugins folder
