Build: LucidBot 3.1

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
There are some database related upgrade issues. If you're updating from a build prior to b44, don't go straight to the 3.1 release. Rather update to 3.0 RC1 first, and then to FINAL afterwards.

What's new:
* Updates for age 59
* Sort bonuses and spells in the race editing popup
* Minor fix to the web service regarding /spells_ops

How to update:
1. Replace LucidBot.jar
2. Replace utopia-ws.jar in the plugins folder
3. Replace utopia-api.jar in the plugins folder
4. Replace utopia-ui.jar in the plugins folder
