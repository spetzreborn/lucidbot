Build: LucidBot 3.0 RC1

What's new:
* The project is now moving from google code to Bitbucket (https://bitbucket.org/fredrik_yttergren/lucidbot). No updates will be done on the google code site anymore, and the documentation will be updated, extended and added to the wiki at Bitbucket instead (work in progress)
* With the move to bitbucket, there will also be a changed in how the bot is distributed. On bitbucket, the downloads section will contain the latest release, but nothing else. Everything else will be on google drive (https://googledrive.com/host/0B8EGJXanSAboeWFRU1pRanJuZGc/)
* Updated some important libraries (database and web server related) to new major versions, so be on the lookout for errors in connection with those things
* The web service API is now final in it's initial release. See the documentation at http://yourhost/api/ when the bot's up and running. You use the forum agent credentials to access it for each user. I really need feedback on this stuff, and want to stress that the current service is in no way written in stone
* The bot has been modularized, which is mostly an internal thing. What affects the users is that UtopiaPlugin.jar in the plugins folder has now been replaced by a bunch of more specialized jar files

How to update:
1. Remove the lib folder completely and replace with the new one
2. Remove the plugin folder completely and replace with the new one
3. Remove the "Core.WebServiceAPI.Enabled" property from utopia.properties
4. Add ws.properties from the zip-file to the root folder next to the other properties files
5. Replace LucidBot.jar with the new one from the zip-file
